TribeTokes is a small company co-owned and run by two powerhouse women and friends of the cannabis industry, in the heart of NYC's meat-packing district. I personally consider them to be like the “Big Sisters” of the local cannabis community.

At **TribeTokes the highest** _quality products_, positive _energy_, love and **female** _ambition_ come together to bring the very best _CBD_ health and beauty products possible to their clientele! You can stock-up at the TribeTokes boutique during one of their amazing open-house events, you can even set up your very own private shopping experience or, shop from the comfort of your own home using their website!

When you shop with TribeTokes, you can rest assured that you are getting the absolute best quality products. Kym and Dege are always on the hunt for the best top-quality products and accessories to bring your life to fun, flirty and trend setting new heights!

TribeTokes offers products like pesticide free CBD dabs, vape cartridges, CBD supplements, CBD infused coffee,edibles and more! They also offer CBD enriched beauty products like KymB’s BEST SELLING CBD eyecream, CannaBlis! (Get it when it is in stock, because it sells out often! It’s a must try beauty product!) The wide array of products they offer makes it easy to bring CBD to nearly every facet of your life, to help you live the most fabulously fit and lit life possible.

The women at TribeTokes aren’t just successful because they sell amazing products, but because they are active in the cannabis industry and community and they work towards empowering other women to live their dreams! TribeTokes is just one on the many ventures KymB and Degelis are a part of! They love to help other women do the same, by working to advocate for women, educate them and help them network with other women to help continue the growth of the community and women as cannabusiness entrepreneurs, or female cannapreneurs! Their energy is majorly positive and something worth experiencing for yourself.
