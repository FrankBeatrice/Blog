**HIGH THERE!**

Welcome to Cannabis with KymB!

My name is Lacey, editor and chief of Cannabis with KymB and I am so glad you are here to join us in this movement! Our goal is to keep you posted on all things KymB and _Cannabis_ related for the east coast! I’m excited to bring you this HUB information on all the exciting things happening in the _cannabis_ movement, especially with legalization on the horizon in so many places, my hope is to help bring you the information that you need to advocate for and educate yourself and others while also working towards breaking the stigma attached to _cannabis_ and those that use it, whether it be medicinally or recreationally.

More than just _cannabis_, Cannabis with KymB is a lifestyle publication that mixes _cannabis_, _CBD_ and wellness together for an all-around well-balanced healthy life.

I’m a _cannabis_ patient from New Jersey, and have been a part of the program for almost four years. I have used _cannabis_ to improve the quality of my life, by **reducing** the pharmaceuticals I need to treat and manage my chronic health conditions. Before being a _cannabis_ patient, I was heavily medicated and almost completely bedridden from pain, crippling brain fog and limited memory. When I didn’t use _cannabis_, I lived dose to dose, unable to function if I missed one, going through almost immediate withdrawals when I was late on a dose. Now, with _cannabis_ use I’m more able to live life the way I want. Being chronically ill limits me greatly, but _cannabis_ has made life more bearable.

I decided to start writing about my _cannabis_ journey after joining an online cannabis networking platform Massroots and I began writing reviews after being burned on an expensive “must have” item that was nothing more than an over-priced paperweight for me! I realized that I was not alone and that I had a voice that resonated with others and other people cared about what I had to say, and for some, my voice was one of hope and inspiration.

Going public with my _cannabis_ use has helped other parents feel less shame for their personal use and have reached out to thank me for being here for them, making a difference to people I had never and may never meet in person has been humbling. I hope to use this voice and these platforms for good and continue to be someone people come to for advice or inspiration, or maybe just honesty. I promise to continue to strive for de-stigmatization of _cannabis_, advocate for use and access, and bring the most honest and accurate information forward, continuing to be a person people can trust and whose opinion is valued.

Aside from my work with Cannabis with KymB, I’m also a mom, I have a son in grade school. When my health allows, I enjoy spending time with my son and boyfriend out in nature, going for walks and to the park whenever possible. I’m an excellent blanket fort or pillow nest maker and binge-watching expert when I can’t get out. You should also see my blunt rolling skills. 

You can find me on Instagram @lacey_project and on Facebook LaceyProject420. I’ve been published by Honeysuckle Magazine and Cannaproscoop. I believe in the healing power of _cannabis_ and the many uses the plant can serve medicinally and beyond. I hope to be a part of the change I wish to see in the world, by changing the stereotypical face of _cannabis_ users while shattering the stigma attached to _cannabis_ use, especially by parents. _Cannabis_ has changed my life and I’d like to see it more widely accepted and accessible for all, improving the quality of life for all.

Stay lifted!
